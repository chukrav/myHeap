<tr><td>Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Strict and clever, she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The ghosts didn’t help, either.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses… I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death—if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. “Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“You—Potter—why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. “Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week—why did Snape hate him so much?</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.” He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. “But he seemed to really hate me.” “Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Investigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. “But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blood was pounding in his ears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy—it’s all right, up you get.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying—” “Bet you could,” Ron muttered. “—and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>The minutes crept by.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>to elbow one's way through the crowd  — протискиваться сквозь толпу, прокладывать себе дорогу в толпе</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had.</td></tr>
<tr><td>She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Mind you, we did save her.” “She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>He had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick—he hit the field on all fours—coughed—and something gold fell into his hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hagrid looked furious with himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Your father left this in my possession before he died.It is time it was returned to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house this summer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it—and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.</td></tr>
<tr><td>However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wood was working the team harder than ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>There was no mistaking that silver beard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.</td></tr>
<tr><td>As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell’s voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has been for ages past, so it is now.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?”</td></tr>
<tr><td>He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess—”</td></tr>
<tr><td>“He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me—as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side…”</td></tr>
<tr><td>No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left.</td></tr>
<tr><td>As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all—the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>… not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast.</td></tr>
